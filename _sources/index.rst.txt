Welcome to pytma's documentation!
====================================

`pytma` is a library for NLP modelling in Python.

We rely on excellent Python libraries nltk, spacy, and gensim for pre-processing and model fitting.

To see how to use it, please refer to the `README file
<https://github.com/brucebcampbell/nlp-modelling/blob/master/README.md>`_ in the Github repository.

This is the general workflow for using the library.
